    <h2>Introducing Strucko - The Expert Dictionary </h2>
    <p>
        Although there are several great (and free) translation services, and 
        thousands of online dictionaries available to us, there is still a 
        huge gap in good online translations for technical or very specific 
        terms related to some area, field, craft, occupation, etc. <br>
        Since the technology is improving on a day to day basis, and every day
        we have new discoveries which are named in one language, there is a 
        delay in <i>official</i> translations to other languages. Those
        official translations can sometimes be cumbersome, clumsy or awkward.
        Because of all that, translators still find it difficult to find 
        appropriate translations in cases when they need to translate some 
        very professional text. <br>
        This is where Strucko comes into play. Strucko is open, free and 
        community driven expert dictionary. As a guest, you are free to see all approved
        terms, translations and definitions. If you want to contribute to the dictionary, 
        you can create an account which will give you permissions to vote on all terms and their
        translations, and also to suggest 
        new terms, translationsto and definitions.
        By voting, you participate in the process of defining the best term and
        translation for particular concept. And that's why Strucko is great -
        it shows us the opinion of the community!
        <br>
        Feel free to contact us if you have any suggestion.
